Note added March 31st 2022 : on the ordering of opriginal data in the results

This wa prompted by a user who found out that the "original data" section of the results were not the same as the input data. Here is the clarification below.

Very early in the process, the data are ordered in order to try to save the initial order (the procedure plays a lot with reordering). This first ordering is very basic and does not take censoring into account. With increasing sample size, it becomes likely that a tie will happen. The issue occurs when a detected and a non detected values are numerical ties (e.g. 0.15 and <0.15) : NDexpo doesn't know well how to order these.

This does not mean the function is mistaken : in the final data set there will be a 0.15 value that was untouched, and one that was transformed according to ROS. The issue is that the function is not able to reorder them exactly as in the initial sample.
